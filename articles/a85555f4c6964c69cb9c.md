# chocolateyとは？

chocolateyがどういうものかは[他の方の記事](https://qiita.com/kangetsu121/items/b6352b547cd32e71bc65)を参照していただいた方がいいです。
雑に言うと、

* windowsでもchocoでyumやらaptっぽいコマンドの振る舞いをさせて
* 作った環境を他のwindows端末にも持っていける

ものです。
これで、新しい端末を使うたびにいちいちダウンロードサイトまで行ってほげほげする必要がなくなります。

# chocolateyで入れられるもの 【2019/08/16時点】
どれができて、どれがだめなん？って情報は重要ですよね。

``` cmd
choco list (なんとか)
```

で、それっぽいものは引けるんですが、何となく眺めたくなったので。
「これも入れられるんだ！」っていう気付きにどうぞ。
（探しやすいようにasciiコード順にソートしています）

# オススメ
とりあえずChocolateyGUI入れて画面から管理できるようにすると捗ります。
そちらだと1ページずつ更新するたびに時間がかかってどうしようもないので、choco listで見た方が楽かもしれません。
なお、choco installとGUI間できちんと連携されていました。
